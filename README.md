In the lending industry, investors provide loans to borrowers in exchange for the promise of repayment with interest. If the borrower repays the loan, then the lender would make profit from the interest. However, if the borrower fails to repay the loan, then the lender loses money. Therefore, lenders face the problem of predicting the risk of a borrower being unable to repay a loan.  The risk associated with making a decision on a loan approval is immense. Hence, the idea of this diploma thesis is to gather loan data from the Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform based in San Francisco, USA, and use machine learning techniques on this data to extract important information and predict if a customer would be able to repay the loan or not. In other words, the goal is to predict if the customer would be Charged-off or not. In this diploma thesis several Machine Learning models(Random Forest, Logistic Regressionand K Nearest Neighbors) are trained to determine if the borrower has the ability to repay its loan. In addition, the performance of the models was analysed. As a result, logistic regression model is found as the optimal predictive model and it is expected that the Interest Rate and the Term significantly influence the forecast.
